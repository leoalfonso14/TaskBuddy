        <h1>What is a Virtual Pet?</h1>
        <p>
          Each time you complete a task you earn points or coins that are used
          to sustain and care for your adorable virtual companion. By nurturing
          your pet, you develop a sense of responsibility and attachment,
          further fueling your motivation to stay productive and achieve your
          goals. The coins you earn will not dictate directly the state of your
          pet, but rather they are used to buy necessities for them, adding an
          element of fun and engagement to your productivity journey. With these
          coins you will be able to buy food and clothes for your pet, among
          other things. Once you have reached a certain number of coins, you are
          eligible for level ups.

        <h1>What Inspired the Virtual Pet</h1>
        <p>
          If you are a Gen-z-er you might be familiar with a popular online
          browser game called Club Penguin. Club Penguin featured a system where
          players could have their own virtual pet called "Puffles." I was
          inspired by the enjoyment and attachment players had with their
          Puffles in Club Penguin, as I experienced it firsthand among myself
          and friends at the time. Although Club Penguin's main audience was
          younger children, gamification can help combat procrastination, which
          affects adults as well. Task Buddy's playful design, can offer a break
          from the seriousness of daily life and serve as a stress-relief tool.
          Adults often have long-term goals they want to achieve, this approach
          can help break them down and make them less daunting and more
          achievable.
